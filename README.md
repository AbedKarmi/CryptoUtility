Crypto Utility for Quran Fidelity

Quran is the greatest book ever found on earth, it was revealed to the last prophet Mohammad peace upon him. 

Nowadays, almost all sensitive data being stored or transferred via any media are protected against loss and change.

people become aware of this privilage, so every piece of data must be protected and highly trusted, otherwise no more confidence is granted.

Quran, is the utmost book that requires such fidelity, we believe that, it must have a proof that is aligned with nowadays modern technologies, since God is the most knowledgeable and the most expert.

Findings:
The Key:
The first Sora of Quran is named ALFATEHA, which means 'the Opener'. We beleive it contains the KEY for verifying the content of the quran.

Text to byte conversion (code page):
We believe that either Arabic Abjadi or Hijaie is being used. Hamza, is to be tested, since it was not used in the revelead text explicitly.

The Signature:
We are looking for this!. It could be a public key, QR code, a hash, or any such information that leads to prove fidelity of the Quran.
